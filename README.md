# Go-Interviews

Go is described as a Statically-typed, compiled language designed by Google around a set of core principles that prioritize Simplicity, Readability, Maintanability and Efficiency.

**Simplicity**: Go's syntax is designed to be straigthfoward to keep code readable, maintainable and easy to learn. By minimizing syntactic clutter such as requiring no parentheses around conditions in control structures or forcing explicit semicolon usage, the language reduces boilerplate and allows developers to focus on the logic.

**Readability**: because is clear, straigthfoward code is easier to maintain, debug and collaborate on. This focus on readability is reflected in Go's design choices such as minimalistic syntax, enforced formating with `gofmt` and explicit error handling.

**Maintainability**: because it recognizes that code is read, modified and extended far more often than it is originally written. This emphasis means that the language and its standar practices are designed to keep the code base simple, consistent and easy to underestand over time.

**Efficiency**: beacause it was designed from the ground up to meet the demands of high-performance, modern software, especially in networked and concurrent enviroments. Key reasons: compiled to native code, ligthweigth concurrency, efficient memory management (GC), simplicity.

### Concurrency
Refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple task through simultaneous executions or time-sharing, managin interactions and sharing resources.

### Parallelism
is the ability to excecute multiple task at the same time using multiple processors(CPUs).

**In Go** concurrency refers to the ability to handle multiple task independently, while parallelism is about executing those task simultaneously on different CPU cores. Go's ***goroutines*** provide ligthweigth threads to run functions concurrently and the ***channels*** facilitates safe comunication between goroutines.

**Goroutine**: is a ligthweigth thread of execution managed by the Go runtime.

**Channels**: are a Data Structure that allows goroutines to communicate and synchronize with each other.

# OOP Concepts in traditional OOP language vs Go

### **1. Classes and Objects**
- **Java**: Classes are the blueprint for objects. Objects are instances of classes with state (fields) and behavior (methods).
  ```java
  public class Car {
    private String model;
    public Car(String model) { this.model = model; }
    public void drive() { System.out.println("Driving " + model); }
  }
  Car myCar = new Car("Tesla");
  ```
- **Go**: No classes. Instead, Go uses **structs** (for data) and attaches **methods** to types (including structs).  
  ```go
  type Car struct { Model string }
  func (c Car) Drive() { fmt.Println("Driving", c.Model) }
  myCar := Car{Model: "Tesla"}
  myCar.Drive()
  ```

---

### **2. Inheritance**
- **Java**: Supports **class inheritance** (`extends`) and **interface implementation** (`implements`).  
  ```java
  class ElectricCar extends Car {
    public void charge() { ... }
  }
  ```
- **Go**: **No inheritance**. Uses **composition** (struct embedding) and **interfaces**.  
  ```go
  type ElectricCar struct {
    Car // Embedded struct (composition)
  }
  func (e *ElectricCar) Charge() { ... }
  ```

---

### **3. Polymorphism**
- **Java**: Achieved via inheritance (method overriding) and interfaces.  
  ```java
  interface Drivable { void drive(); }
  class Car implements Drivable { ... }
  ```
- **Go**: Achieved through **interfaces** (implicitly implemented). A type satisfies an interface if it implements its methods.  
  ```go
  type Drivable interface { Drive() }
  // Car implicitly satisfies Drivable if it has a Drive() method.
  ```

---

### **4. Encapsulation**
- **Java**: Uses `private`/`public` modifiers to control access to fields/methods.  
  ```java
  private String model; // Only accessible within the class
  public void drive() { ... } // Accessible everywhere
  ```
- **Go**: Uses **capitalization** for visibility (e.g., `Model` is public, `model` is private). No explicit keywords.  
  ```go
  type Car struct {
    model string // private (lowercase)
    Model string // public (uppercase)
  }
  ```

---

### **5. Abstraction**
- **Java**: Uses `abstract` classes and interfaces to define contracts.  
  ```java
  abstract class Vehicle { abstract void start(); }
  class Car extends Vehicle { void start() { ... } }
  ```
- **Go**: Achieved via **interfaces** and **function types**. No abstract classes.  
  ```go
  type Starter interface { Start() }
  type Car struct{}
  func (c Car) Start() { ... } // Implements Starter
  ```

---

### **6. Constructors**
- **Java**: Explicit constructors with `new` keyword.  
  ```java
  public Car(String model) { this.model = model; }
  Car car = new Car("Tesla");
  ```
- **Go**: No constructors. Uses **factory functions** (e.g., `NewCar()`).  
  ```go
  func NewCar(model string) Car { return Car{Model: model} }
  myCar := NewCar("Tesla")
  ```

---

### **7. Method Overloading**
- **Java**: Supports method overloading (same name, different parameters).  
  ```java
  void drive() { ... }
  void drive(int speed) { ... }
  ```
- **Go**: **No method overloading**. Use unique method names or variadic functions.  
  ```go
  func Drive() { ... }
  func DriveWithSpeed(speed int) { ... }
  ```

---

### **8. Generics**
- **Java**: Uses generics for type-safe code.  
  ```java
  List<String> list = new ArrayList<>();
  ```
- **Go**: Introduced generics in Go 1.18 (simpler syntax, used sparingly).  
  ```go
  func PrintSlice[T any](s []T) { ... }
  ```

### **Key Differences Summary**
| **Concept**       | **Java (Traditional OOP)**                | **Go (Idiomatic Approach)**               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Inheritance**    | Class-based (`extends`/`implements`)      | Composition and struct embedding          |
| **Polymorphism**   | Explicit interface implementation         | Implicit interfaces (duck typing)         |
| **Encapsulation**  | `private`/`public` keywords               | Capitalization for visibility             |
| **Error Handling** | Exceptions (`try`/`catch`)                | Explicit error return values              |
| **Concurrency**    | Threads, `synchronized` blocks            | Goroutines and channels (CSP model)       |
| **Abstraction**    | Abstract classes, interfaces              | Interfaces and function types             |
| **Constructors**   | Constructor methods                       | Factory functions (e.g., `NewX()`)        |

### **Why Go Differs**
Go intentionally avoids traditional OOP features like inheritance and overloading to prioritize:
1. **Simplicity**: Less cognitive overhead.
2. **Composition**: Flexible code reuse without rigid hierarchies.
3. **Explicitness**: Clear error handling and minimal hidden behavior.
4. **Concurrency**: Lightweight goroutines over heavy threads.

As Rob Pike noted:  
*"Go is about composition, not inheritance."*  

While Go isnâ€™t strictly OOP, its focus on **interfaces**, **structs**, and **composition** provides a pragmatic way to model real-world problems while maintaining readability and performance.

### REST

**Representational State Transfer** is a software architecture that imposes conditions on how an API should work.
Principles of the REST architectural style:
1. **Statelessness**: Each request contains all the information needed to process it, and no client context is stored on the server.
2. **Client-Server Separation**: The clien and server are independent of each other.
3. **Uniform Interface**: Consistent and Standarized communication, typically via HTTP methods.
4. **Cacheability**: Responses should indicate whether they can be cached for future use.
5. **Layered System**: Architecture should allow for layers such as proxies, gateways, and load balancers.

Benefits:
1. Scalability
2. Flexibility
3. Independence

RESTful API request contain:
1. Unique Resourse Identifier (URI)
2. Method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
3. HTTP Headers
4. Data
5. Parameters

## Race Condition vs. Deadlock

### Race Condition:
Occurs when two or more threads or processes access shared data concurrently, and the final outcome depends on the unpredictable timing or sequence of execution.
It can lead to inconsistent or unexpected behavior because the operations interleave in unforeseen ways.
Example: Two threads updating the same counter without proper synchronization may result in an incorrect count.

### Deadlock:
Happens when two or more processes are each waiting for the other to release a resource, leading to a standstill where none of them can proceed.
It is characterized by a circular dependency among processes, where each holds a resource and waits for another.
Example: Process A holds resource X and waits for resource Y, while Process B holds resource Y and waits for resource X.

Key Differences:

**Nature**:
- Race Condition: A timing issue that affects data consistency.
- Deadlock: A resource allocation issue that halts system progress.

**Symptoms**:
- Race Condition: Unpredictable outcomes or corrupted data.
- Deadlock: System freeze or unresponsive behavior as processes wait indefinitely.

**Mitigation**:
- Race Condition: Use proper synchronization mechanisms like locks, mutexes, or atomic operations.
- Deadlock: Employ strategies such as resource ordering, deadlock detection and recovery, or avoiding circular wait conditions.
