# Go-Interviews

## History

Go is a statically typed, compiled high-level general purpose programming language. It was designed at Google in 2009 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is syntactically similar to C, but also has memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and [CSP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communicating_sequential_processes)-style concurrency. It is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but its proper name is Go.

Statically typed: In computer programming, a type system is a logical system comprising a set of rules that assigns a property called a type (for example, integer, floating point, string) to every term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Usually the terms are various language constructs of a computer program, such as variables, expressions, functions, or modules. A type system dictates the operations that can be performed on a term. For variables, the type system determines the allowed values of that term.
